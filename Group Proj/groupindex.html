      With nearly 10 million residents, the city of Chicago is the third most populous city in the United States. Like many large cities, transportation and the daily emissions from residents contribute significantly to Chicago air pollution.

      Chicago is a major national hub of transport at the crossroads of the country’s rail, road, and air traffic. The Chicago area has the most federal highways and is the second-most visited city in the country, with one of the busiest airports in the world (O’Hare International Airport). </p>
  
  <p> In recent years, transport emissions stemming from planes, trains, boats, automobiles, and locomotives have overtaken highly regulated coal as the city’s largest emission source.</p>
  
  <p>Temperature inversions caused by a warm air layer topping a cooler air layer below can further exacerbate Chicago AQI levels. These weather events are not uncommon during the summer when cooler air from Lake Michigan is prevented from dispersing from under the warm air above, causing pollution to accumulate. <p>

   <p> A green roof is a rooftop covered with vegetation and soil that can reduce stormwater runoff and improve air quality. It filters out harmful air particles like smog and carbon dioxide. </p>
  
  <p> Air pollution is a complex problem requiring a multifaceted approach. Over the last three decades, the United States federal government, State of Illinois, and City of Chicago have legislated for cleaner air. </p>

  <p> While significant improvements have been made, air pollution levels in Cook County and Chicago remain “unhealthy” by EPA standards.</p>
