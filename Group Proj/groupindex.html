<h1 id="Top">Chicago’s Air Pollution Crisis: What’s Being Done to Clear the Air?</h1>
<h3> By: Alexia Kadota-Browner, Angelica Luo, Finya Swai, Menatalla Ibrahim </h3>

  <p>With a population nearing <strong>10 million</strong>, Chicago stands as the <strong>third-largest city in the United States</strong> and a critical hub for <strong>transportation and commerce</strong>. However, the very infrastructure that fuels its economy—<strong>bustling highways, major rail lines, and one of the world’s busiest airports</strong>—also drives one of its most persistent environmental crises: <strong>air pollution</strong>.</p>
        
  <p>For decades, Chicago has struggled with <strong>high levels of fine particulate matter (PM2.5), ozone (O₃), and nitrogen oxides (NOx)</strong>—pollutants linked to <strong>respiratory disease, cardiovascular issues, and premature death</strong>. While <strong>federal regulations and local initiatives</strong> have helped reduce emissions in recent years, <a href="https://www.epa.gov/il/southeast-chicago-ambient-air-quality-analysis?utm_source=chatgpt.com">new data</a> suggests that <strong>transportation and industrial pollution</strong> remain major contributors to the city’s air quality crisis.</p>
  
  <p>In addition, a <strong>2023 report from <a href="https://www.iqair.com/us/usa/illinois/chicago?srsltid=AfmBOopWjIGoxKGQcrQt2J02a7QtK9DUwQiaypIBcitJRgQyFlIK0teR">IQAir</a></strong> ranked Chicago among the <strong>most polluted cities in the United States</strong>, with air quality levels that frequently <strong>exceed federal safety standards</strong>. <strong>Low-income and industrial neighborhoods</strong> remain pollution hotspots, putting residents at a <strong>higher risk of chronic respiratory illnesses</strong>.</p>

      <h2>Chicago: A Transportation Hub Driving Air Pollution</h2>
      <p>Chicago’s role as a <strong>national transportation hub</strong> has positioned it as a powerhouse for <strong>commerce, tourism, and logistics</strong>. However, the city’s <strong>heavy reliance on transportation infrastructure</strong>—including <strong>airports, highways, freight trains, and shipping routes</strong>—has also made it one of the <strong>nation’s largest emitters of transportation-related pollution</strong>.</p>
      <p>The city has the most federal highways of any U.S. city, resulting in <a href="https://idot.illinois.gov/content/dam/soi/en/web/idot/documents/transportation-system/reports/opp/travel-stats/2022-il-hwy-statistics-sheet.pdf">severe congestion</a> and high vehicle emissions. Additionally, O’Hare International Airport is among the world’s busiest airports, handling over <a href="https://www.faa.gov/">79 million passengers annually</a>. It is also the largest rail hub in North America, with <a href="https://cmap.illinois.gov/wp-content/uploads/FY17-0095-Freight-Snapshot.pdf">25% of the nation’s freight traffic</a> passing through each year. Diesel-powered freight trains, trucks, and cargo ships further contribute to high concentrations of nitrogen oxides (NOx) and fine particulate matter (PM2.5), worsening air quality across the region.</p>
      <p>As a result, transportation-related emissions have surpassed coal as the city’s largest source of air pollution, <a href="https://www.transportation.gov/sites/dot.gov/files/2023-12/IL_2023_State_Freight.pdf">according to the EPA</a>. Among the most harmful pollutants are fine particulate matter (PM2.5), nitrogen oxides (NOx), and carbon monoxide (CO). PM2.5 consists of tiny airborne particles that penetrate deep into the lungs, increasing the risk of heart disease, lung cancer, and respiratory illness. NOx gases, primarily emitted from vehicle and industrial exhaust, contribute to ground-level ozone (smog), which can worsen asthma and other respiratory conditions. Meanwhile, carbon monoxide (CO) is a colorless, odorless gas that reduces oxygen delivery to the body, posing serious health risks, particularly for children and the elderly.</p>

      <h2>What’s Being Done to Combat Air Pollution?</h2>
      <p>Despite policy changes and environmental initiatives, Chicago still faces persistent air quality challenges, particularly in low-income and industrial neighborhoods. City officials, environmental advocates, and businesses are working on new solutions to curb emissions.</p>
      <p>One of Chicago’s most successful environmental strategies is the expansion of green roofs—vegetated rooftop systems that help filter pollutants, lower temperatures, and manage stormwater runoff.</p>
      <p>Chicago leads the nation in <strong>green roof adoption</strong>, with over <a href="https://www.chicago.gov/city/en/depts/dcd/supp_info/chicago_green_roofs.html">500 green roofs</a> covering more than <strong>5.5 million square feet</strong>.</p>

    <h2>Air Quality Today: Is Chicago Making Progress?</h2>
    <p>However, despite some improvements, <a href="https://www.iqair.com/us/usa/illinois/chicago?srsltid=AfmBOopWjIGoxKGQcrQt2J02a7QtK9DUwQiaypIBcitJRgQyFlIK0teR">air pollution levels</a> in Chicago remain a serious health concern, with many neighborhoods still exceeding federal safety standards. Cook County consistently ranks among the worst in the nation for ozone pollution, <a href="https://www.lung.org/research/sota">according to the American Lung Association</a>.</p>
