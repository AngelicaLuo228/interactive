   <!-- Introduction paragraph with key statistics about Chicago's air pollution crisis -->
   <p>With a population nearing <strong>10 million</strong>, Chicago stands as the <strong>third-largest city in the United States</strong> and a critical hub for <strong>transportation and commerce</strong>. However, the very infrastructure that fuels its economy—<strong>bustling highways, major rail lines, and one of the world’s busiest airports</strong>—also drives one of its most persistent environmental crises: <strong>air pollution</strong>.</p>
   
   <!-- Discussion of pollutants and health impacts -->
   <p>For decades, Chicago has struggled with <strong>high levels of fine particulate matter (PM2.5), ozone (O₃), and nitrogen oxides (NOx)</strong>—pollutants linked to <strong>respiratory disease, cardiovascular issues, and premature death</strong>. While <strong>federal regulations and local initiatives</strong> have helped reduce emissions in recent years, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.epa.gov/il/southeast-chicago-ambient-air-quality-analysis?utm_source=chatgpt.com">new data</a> suggests that <strong>transportation and industrial pollution</strong> remain major contributors to the city’s air quality crisis.</p>

   <!-- Statistical ranking of Chicago’s pollution status -->
   <p>In addition, a <strong>2023 report from <a target="_blank" href="https://www.iqair.com/us/usa/illinois/chicago?srsltid=AfmBOopWjIGoxKGQcrQt2J02a7QtK9DUwQiaypIBcitJRgQyFlIK0teR">IQAir</a></strong> ranked Chicago among the <strong>most polluted cities in the United States</strong>, with air quality levels that frequently <strong>exceed federal safety standards</strong>. <strong>Low-income and industrial neighborhoods</strong> remain pollution hotspots, putting residents at a <strong>higher risk of chronic respiratory illnesses</strong>.</p>

       <h2>Chicago: A Transportation Hub Driving Air Pollution</h2>
       <p>Chicago’s role as a <strong>national transportation hub</strong> has positioned it as a powerhouse for <strong>commerce, tourism, and logistics</strong>. However, the city’s <strong>heavy reliance on transportation infrastructure</strong>—including <strong>airports, highways, freight trains, and shipping routes</strong>—has also made it one of the <strong>nation’s largest emitters of transportation-related pollution</strong>.</p>

       <h2>Air Quality Today: Is Chicago Making Progress?</h2>
       <p>However, despite some improvements, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.iqair.com/us/usa/illinois/chicago?srsltid=AfmBOopWjIGoxKGQcrQt2J02a7QtK9DUwQiaypIBcitJRgQyFlIK0teR">air pollution levels</a> in Chicago remain a serious health concern, with many neighborhoods still exceeding federal safety standards.
