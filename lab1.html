        As Los Angeles residents fled the raging wildfire, many were forced to
        leave pets behind. Rescue-foster organization
        <a href="https://www.friendsofnormie.com/">Friends of Normie</a>
        is there to help.

        Founded in 2020 and based in So-Cal, Friends of Normie specializes in
        (re)homing cats and kitties. Under current circumstances, it pivoted to
        find sanctuaries for all animals. So far, they have saved over 100 cats!
