<h3>Brewing Comfort One Cauldron at a Time</h3>
<h5>Nov. 18, 2024</h5>
<h5>Witchcraft shop helps Chicagoan community cope with election results.</h5>

<p>ROGERS PARK – Raw crystals, tarot cards and rabbit feet rest quietly in designated nooks. Occult books compound a vault of enchanted wisdom, and a broom hovers over a spell jar station.</p>
<p>Nestled on Morse Avenue, the Malliway Bros. Magic & Witchcraft shop sells every niche tool and object imaginable to practice magic, amassing a sizable following across Chicago, according to shop owners. </p>
<p>But this coven is much more than a Halloween pastime. As the nation navigates shifts in the political landscape, Malliway Bros. strives to pamper its community, providing tools to cope with negativity caused by another Trump administration. </p>
<p>Repurposed from an apothecary, this establishment continues to heal Chicagoans in today’s challenging environment, said staff member Lucas Lona.</p>
<p>“A lot of folks don't feel supported, not only en masse in a system but also in day-to-day lives. We help people find their voice in an abstract way – witchcraft can be a center for expression,” said Lona. Customers come to heal, especially from the recently concluded presidential election, he added. </p>
<p>The store was founded by brothers Wycke and Blake Malliway, and it aims to both supply witchy items and cultivate a sense of community, they said.</p>
<p>“Our mission was to create a place where people on the fringes could come in and grow together,” said co-founder Blake.</p>
<p>Malliway Bros holds an average of 15 monthly events, some even after business hours, to connect like-minded individuals. On sabbats and holidays, when all are welcome to celebrate for free, it often hosts 75 to 100 people to meet and mingle.</p>

<p>The premises’ lounge space also contributes to community building. “Folks hang out there to just absorb the space. Many said this is where they feel more like themselves,” said Lona.</p>
<p>By the couches, a bulletin board posts queer resources and feminist movements in the neighborhood. The more the community works together, the less animosity there will be between people, Blake said about this collaborative initiative.</p>
<p>Patron Luke Greeff frequents the shop as “a mental health ritual.” Every time Greeff visits, he purchases herbs and scented candles for his home; this gives him comfort.</p>
<p>“Malliway Bros serves as a second space for people like me who may not feel as comfortable in other spaces in the area, especially white-dominated, cis-dominated, straight-dominated or Christian-dominated spaces,” said Greeff. He considers the shop a safe resort in Rogers Park.</p>
<p>For a similar reason, Mary Clemente, a regular at the shop, connects deeply with the staff and returns for comfort. “When things like [the election] make everybody feel unstable and uneasy, they search for things to dive into and sort out their feelings. The occult is unexplainable, but I think people find solace in it,” said Clemente.</p>
<p>Despite instabilities, the Malliway Bros. Magic & Witchcraft shop remains Rogers Park’s guardian spell against rhetorics that jeopardize the marginalized, said Blake.</p>

<h3>Old Book, New Page</h3>
<h5>Nov. 13, 2024</h5>
<h5>Indie bookshops thrive in Rogers Park, Chicago, despite influx of corporate counterparts.</h5>
<img

<p>ROGERS PARK – Fluorescent beams radiated from the Jarvis Red Line station and a storage unit, sending a chill down alleyways. Sandwiched between the two, a small bookstore fostered its own warmth.  </p>
<p>For owner Kate Harding, Jarvis Square Books is her “lifelong dream come true.” Mindful of the shop’s four-block periphery, Harding collects used book loved by local readers and sells them at reasonable prices</p>
<p>“It's being part of this community and knowing we're here. It doesn’t matter if it’s [making] a sale,” said Harding. Surveying her one-month-old shop, she gleamed with joy.  </p>
<p>In Chicago’s North Side, independent bookshops of used books, like Harding’s, are not unpopular. Many of the small shops in the area harbor a community, bringing people together through a genuine, unwavering love for books. </p>
<p>Thanks to these organic connections, locally founded booksellers can stand their ground, continuing to flourish despite an influx of corporate competition.</p>
<p>Within the past six months, five Barnes & Noble locations opened in the Chicago area. Its most recent opening at Wicker Park’s historic Noel State Bank building upheld a significant online presence.</p>
<p>Still, indie used bookshops, like Harding’s, have encountered little difficulty securing their specialties and regular patrons.</p>
<p>“We can have things very different from what you find at other bookstores. The value of mom-and-pop stores is being able to know their communities and that exchange,” said Harding. Already seeing customers returning, Harding does not consider Barnes & Noble to be a threat.</p>
<img
src="https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/67881d5068fa1d6d4bdbacef/1be7284f-5f2a-4a5d-a8d1-85d212a9bfba/2.jpg?format=2500w"
width="80%"/>
<p>A little south of Jarvis Square Books, fellow used bookstore Heirloom Books also prospers. Erik Graff, co-director of this establishment and supporter of Jarvis Square Books, echoed Harding’s optimism.</p>
<p>“Since we're not for profit, we do what we can to support all the local bookstores. We're not in competition with them. We're here to help them. So I hope Barnes & Noble is successful,” he said.</p>
<p>By Graff’s side, Allon Segev sank into the shop’s leather couch. Setting aside his book, Segev highlighted small bookshops’ appeal.</p>
<p>“A single tiny used bookstore would give its area color and meaning. It gathers people,” Segev said. </p>
<p>Downstairs, Lara Ansari pored over Heirloom’s poetry collection.</p>
<p>“At Barnes & Noble, you can find what's out on the market. But if I just want to spend an afternoon browsing and decompressing, I would come here,” said Ansari. Heirloom puts her in a different state of mind, she added.</p>
<p>Despite their steady growth, local bookshops still need support. Graff advised readers to donate books and help shops grow publicity.</p>
<p>“Tell your friends, come in and say ‘hi!’” suggested Harding with glee.</p>

<h3>Chicago's Rogers Park: Eras Lost in Gentrification</h3>
<h5>Oct. 7, 2024</h5>
<img
src="https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/67881d5068fa1d6d4bdbacef/1737483131472-BI2052QHLDSJHU435ABX/IMG_5169.jpg?format=1500w"

<p>Three words stretched across Momo’s otherwise plain shirt – “Reduce, Reuse, Recycle.” Situated amid a grandeur assortment of vintage gems, the shop attendant shared: “I view gentrification as a force that makes an area one-dimensional.”</p>
<p>Established 55 years ago, Lost Eras remains a popular thrifting spot in Rogers Park. As the name suggests, the maximalist premise holds a collection of over 50,000 antiques awaiting rediscovery.</p>
<p>Store staffer Momo expressed a passion for preserving community quirks, especially through connections built upon item exchanges. “I want cool people to have cool stuff,” he said. His work, however, has met a boulder.</p>
<p>Rogers Park, an organic synthesis of various cultures, now faces a homogenous future of gentrification, according to Rogers Park residents. What used to be a historic space with unique personalities is now plastered with uniform blocks and tiles, while long-term residents —or “characters of the neighborhood,” per Momo — struggle with rising rent. The neighborhood has been squished into a readily marketable sentence, Momo also remarked.</p>
<p>Resident Jenna Berry said that, even as a newcomer, she had expected the neighborhood’s gentrification, particularly for its advertised desirability.</p>
<p>Flipping through Lost Eras’ yellowed pages and record sleeves, Berry added later that gentrification has reached even cyber communities of vintage shopping, manifesting through price inflations on formerly affordable resale platforms.</p>
<img
src="https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/67881d5068fa1d6d4bdbacef/5d43128a-b857-4444-9b8f-30d5c61df3ce/IMG_5166.jpg?format=2500w"
width="70%"
/>
<p>Another resident of the area, Nadia Spock, highlighted housing affordability issues, which stemmed primarily from the arrival of new businesses. Upon that note, Spock expressed appreciation for Lost Eras: “A lot of vintage stores run by younger people may be more of a result of gentrification. Whereas this business feels like a neighborhood staple.”</p>
<p>The owner of the shop, Charlotte Walters, however, acknowledged the bright side of gentrification, contending that century-old architectures are deteriorating, and gentrification provides necessary facelifts to mitigate safety concerns.</p>
<p>“If you don't fix your property, people will move elsewhere,” she explained. This stance was somewhat dittoed by shop visitor Amy Eisenman, who said, as an active witness of rather than a protestor against gentrification, she isn’t opposed to change.</p>
