<p>CHICAGO – Spring, tulips and St. Paddy’s Day are just around the corner. Need proof? Lake Michigan’s no longer frozen blues and 
  Chicagoans enjoying sunny latte breaks. After consecutive weeks of negative temperatures, the city finally warms up to welcome March.</p>

<p>As a metropolitan with over <a href="https://rentechdigital.com/smartscraper/business-report-details/united-states/illinois/list-of-coffee-shops-in-chicago?utm_source=chatgpt.com">3,000</a> 
coffee shops, Chicago knows how much its hard-working people value caffeine. However, according to the Chicago Data Portal’s census data, 
the city issues more sidewalk cafe permits in wards of higher family income.</p>

<p>According to a dataset updated on March 2, 2025, the Windy City hosts a total of 1,811 unexpired curbside cafe permits, allowing eateries 
  and beverage shops to accommodate customers outdoors and on public pavement. As the winter weather slowly nears its end and citizens start 
  catching up on vitamin D, this number only sees to grow.</p>

<p>Amid Chicago's 50 wards, 42, 27 and 34 are the top three locations with the highest counts, granting 237, 159 and 143 permits, respectively. 
  The Loop, Near North, Lincoln Park, Lakeview and Near West areas stand out substantially from other counterparts, cultivating a congregated 
  city-center hub of outdoor cafes.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the local American Community Survey result indicates an overlap between said sidewalk cafe epicenter and income distribution. 
  Aggregated by wards, this data set is updated every five years. The most recent set, published in 2023, tallies a local population of 2,649,803, 
  among which a total of 197,818 families make an annual income of over $125,000, the highest earning category compared to others of under $25,000, 
  $25,000 to $49,999, $50,000 to $74,999 and $75,000 to $125,000.</p>

<p>Within this group, wards 42, 32 and 47 are home to the most high-income households, lodging 10.5K, 9342 and 8877 families, respectively.</p>

<p>The 42nd Ward, home of the Riverwalk and world-famous tourist attractions, tops both data charts. Additionally, 
  as seen in the interactive maps above, central-northern wards of Chicago demonstrate a high concentration of both sidewalk cafe permits 
  and high-income homes. This is not unexpected for the ward’s vicinity to the Chicago River, Michigan Lake, Cloud Gate and Navy Pier.</p>

<p>For the same reason, adjacent community areas also provide the least affordable rental housing, according to the Chicago Data Portal.</p>

<p>Interestingly, residents of the 41st Ward also demonstrate a high level of annual income, 
  while the region also lacks greatly in curbside cafe permits. 
  This is likely because of O'Hare International Airport, which takes up 7,627 acres of the ward.</p>
